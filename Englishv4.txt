The midsummer's loon flew over a swamp and landed at the base of a great tree. The water bird laid three eggs. The first egg rolled from the nest and cracked. Blood flowed from the crack for seven days and seven nights. From the blood life and death were formed. 
The egg white flowed west, forming the cold and the ice.
The shell became the earth and mountains. 
The yolk flowed east, becoming heat and flame. 
Finally, the egg hatched, and from it came Nature.
Nature created the laws of nature, set the animals, meadows, rivers, hills and mountains.
Day and night passed. Nature worked by itself. It looked at its creations and was satisfied with them.
There was harmony in the world. 
The second egg hatched, and from it Magic was born.
It looked at the creations of Nature and gave them a soul. Not just to the animals, but to materials, too. 
The burden of the soul refined and twisted the creations
of Nature. The nobleness of gold gave it its shine.
The indolence of mud gave it a pungent smell. 
Magic broke the laws of nature. Nature and Magic began to argue about how the world ought to be. 
The last egg hatched, and from it Technology was born. Technology gave the animals of Nature the ability to use machines and devices. 
Emerald Tablet - volume I
Tis true without lying, certain and most true.
That which is below is like that which is above
and that which is above is like that which is below
to do the miracles of one only thing.
And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: 
so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
Emerald Tablet of Thoth
The necessity of concealing the Art is
one of the chief anxieties of alchemists. 
We are sworn to secrecy by heaven and earth and hell,
by the four elements, by the height and the depth,
by Hermes, by Anubis,and by the howlings of Kerkoros.
An oath has been required of us to reveal
nothing clearly to any uninitiated being.
Emerald Tablet - volume II
Thence is born a spirit white as snow, 
and another spirit red as blood,
which two spirits are contained in a third hidden thing.
Emerald Tablet - volume III
Heed my warning or death and decay will follow.
Emerald Tablet - volume IV
The definition of death is the disjunction of the composite, 
but there is no disjunction of that which is simple, for it is one.
Death consists in the separation of the soul from the body,
because anything formed out of two, three,
or four components must disintegrate, and this is death.
Understand, further, that no complex substance which lacks fire eats, 
drinks, or sleeps, because in all things which have a spirit 
fire is that which eats.

Emerald Tablet - volume V
And the Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt hou take out the Holy Pin.
Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less.
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, 
and the number of the counting shall be three. 
Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two,
excepting that thou then proceed to three.
Five is right out. Once at the number three, 
being the third number be reached, then,
lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards 
thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'
Emerald Tablet - volume VI
Some Alchemists fancy that the work from beginning 
to end is a mere idle entertainment; but those who 
make it so will reap what they have sown - nothing. 
We know that next to the Divine Blessing,
and the discovery of the proper foundation,
nothing is so important as unwearied industry
and perseverance in this First Operation.
It is no wonder, then, that so many students
of this Art are reduced to beggary;
they are afraid of work, and look upon our Art as 
mere sport for their leisure moments. For no labour 
is more tedious than that which the preparatory part 
of our enterprise demands. 

Emerald Tablet - volume VII
Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals,
however, there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment.
A person who studies this Art, must have either everything or nothing.
An Alchemist who knows only half their craft, reaps nothing but disappointment 
and waste of time and money; moreover, they lay themselves open to the mockery 
of those who despise our Art. Those, indeed, who succeed in reaching the goal 
of the Magistery, have not only infinite riches, but the means of continued 
life and health. Hence it is the most popular of all pursuits. , , , , , , , , , , ,,doesn't need to be translated,
Emerald Tablet - volume VIII
Woe unto all ye fools. 
How ignorant are ye of this Art, for which ye would die if ye knew it. 
I swear to you that if kings were familiar with it, 
none of us would ever attain this thing. 
O how this nature changeth body into spirit. 
O how admirable is Nature, how she presides over all, and overcomes all.

Emerald Tablet - volume IX
In this way, then, Nature generates by means of 
this sulphur the different kinds of metals in the 
veins of the earth, according to the diversity of 
degrees and alterations.

Emerald Tablet - volume X
Take, he tells us, the stone of gold, combine with humour which is 
permanent water, set in its vessel, over a gentle fire until liquefaction 
takes place. Then leave it until the water dries, and the sand and 
water are combined, one with another; then let the fire be more intense
than before, until it again becomes dry, and is made earth. When this is done, 
understand that here is the beginning of the arcanum; but do this many times,
until two-thirds of the water perish, and colours manifest unto you.
Tabula Smaragdina
If all the mountains were of silver and gold, what would 
they profit a man who lives in constant fear of death? 
Hence there cannot be in the whole world anything better than our Medicine,
which has power to heal all the diseases of the flesh.
